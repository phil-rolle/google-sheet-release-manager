# ‚òÅÔ∏è GCP ‚Üî AWS Cloud Service Mapping for Upgrade System

This document maps the components used in the bespoke upgrade system from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to their Amazon Web Services (AWS) equivalents. It is useful for demonstrating cloud-agnostic design thinking in system interviews.

## üîê Security Notes

- Both clouds support fine-grained IAM and secure credential storage.
- SSM documents (AWS) and OS Config policies (GCP) support access-logged remote execution.
- GitOps pipelines can enforce signed commits, branch protection, and review before rollout.
- Consider enabling CloudTrail (AWS) or Audit Logs (GCP) for visibility into rollout actions.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This mapping ensures that your upgrade system design is easily portable between GCP and AWS, and is ready to evolve toward a modern, GitOps-based model that emphasizes declarative infrastructure, safety, and automation.
