# System Design Interview Preparation: Collaborative Design Exploration

## 🧩 1. “What If” Scenarios

### ➤ What if we needed to support 10,000 servers instead of 1,500?
> I’d move away from polling and scheduled tasks toward an event-driven model using pub/sub or message queues. I’d also shard metadata by service or region and use a distributed config store like AWS AppConfig or GCP Runtime Config to reduce bottlenecks.

### ➤ What if we moved from GCP to AWS?
> I’d map each GCP component to its AWS equivalent:
- `gcloud metadata` → EC2 Tags or SSM Parameter Store  
- Stackdriver → CloudWatch  
- Task server → Lambda or Step Functions  
- Sheets → Git + YAML in CodeCommit  
This would preserve the core logic while aligning with AWS-native tools.

### ➤ What if we needed real-time updates instead of polling?
> I’d replace polling with a push-based model using Pub/Sub (GCP) or SNS/SQS (AWS). Servers could subscribe to config changes and react immediately. This would reduce latency and improve responsiveness.

### ➤ What if we needed to support multiple teams or services?
> I’d introduce namespaces or scopes in the metadata and config. Each team would manage its own config files or sheets, and access would be controlled via IAM roles or Git permissions.

## ⚖️ 2. Trade-off Discussions

### ➤ Would you use a database, a config repo, or a spreadsheet for metadata?
> For small teams or early-stage projects, a spreadsheet is fast and accessible. For larger systems, a Git-based config repo offers versioning and auditability. A database adds flexibility but increases complexity. I’d choose based on scale and team maturity.

### ➤ Would you choose Step Functions, Argo Workflows, or a custom script runner?
> Step Functions are great for AWS-native, low-maintenance workflows. Argo is powerful for Kubernetes environments. A custom runner gives full control but adds operational overhead. I’d prefer managed services unless we need custom logic.

### ➤ Would you store metadata in SSM Parameter Store, DynamoDB, or Git?
> Git is ideal for versioned, human-readable config. Parameter Store is better for runtime access and secrets. DynamoDB is great for high-throughput, structured metadata. I’d use Git for config and Parameter Store for runtime flags.

### ➤ Would you prioritize IAM-based access or Git-based approvals?
> Git-based approvals are better for auditability and traceability. IAM is stronger for runtime enforcement. Ideally, I’d use both: Git for change control, IAM for execution-time access.

## 🛠️ 3. System Extensions

### ➤ How would you add dashboards or metrics for rollout health?
> I’d expose metrics like rollout duration, success/failure rates, and per-server status. In AWS, I’d use CloudWatch dashboards; in GCP, Cloud Monitoring. For richer insights, I’d integrate with Grafana or Looker.

### ➤ How would you ensure traceability of every change?
> I’d log every change with a timestamp, user ID, and before/after state. In a GitOps model, this is built-in via commit history. I’d also integrate with audit tools like CloudTrail or GCP Audit Logs.

### ➤ How would you implement automatic rollback on failure?
> I’d monitor rollout health and trigger a rollback if failure thresholds are exceeded. In GitOps, this could be a revert commit. In AWS, I’d use Step Functions with failure branches or AppConfig rollback triggers.

### ➤ Could you integrate a feature flag system like LaunchDarkly?
> Yes, I’d use feature flags for fine-grained control over rollouts. This would decouple deployment from release and allow safer experimentation. LaunchDarkly or AWS AppConfig would work well.

### ➤ Would you build a UI for non-technical users to manage releases?
> If the user base includes non-engineers, a UI improves usability and reduces errors. I’d build a simple web app backed by Git or a config API, with role-based access and audit logging.

## 🤝 4. Collaborative Brainstorming

### ➤ What would you improve in your original design if you had unlimited time?
> I’d replace Sheets with Git-based config, use a workflow engine for orchestration, and add observability and self-healing. I’d also invest in a UI and better testing infrastructure.

### ➤ What’s the simplest way to make this system more resilient?
> Add retries, health checks, and circuit breakers. Use managed services where possible to reduce operational risk. Also, ensure all operations are idempotent.

### ➤ How would you design this system for a startup vs. an enterprise?
> For a startup: prioritize speed and simplicity—use Sheets or GitHub and scripts.  
For an enterprise: prioritize auditability, scalability, and compliance—use GitOps, IAM, and managed services.

### ➤ What’s a completely different approach you’d consider today?
> I’d consider using a service mesh or centralized config service like Consul or AWS AppConfig, combined with GitOps and CI/CD pipelines. This would offer better scalability, observability, and control.
